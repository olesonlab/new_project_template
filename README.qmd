### `functions/` {#functions}

-   **Description**: Contains R scripts with functions to automate tasks and manage dependencies.
-   **Key Script**: `install_packages_and_load_libraries.R` to install and load necessary R packages for the project.

### `renv/`

-   **Description**: Directory used by the `{renv}` package to manage the project's R environment. It contains all the package versions and configurations required to reproduce the project's setup.
-   **Usage**: Automatically created and managed by `{renv}` to ensure that the same package versions are used across different environments and by different users.

## Key Files {#key-files}

### Quarto Configuration {#quarto-configuration}

-   **`.quarto.yml`**: Configuration file for Quarto, specifying settings for document and website rendering, including the output directory (`docs/`).

### R Project Configuration {#r-project-configuration}

-   **`new_project_template.Rproj`**: R project file for easy project setup in RStudio.

### `index.qmd`

-   **Description**: The main Quarto document that serves as the homepage for the project website. This file is used to create the primary content and structure of the site.
-   **Usage**: Edit this file to update the main content of your project's website. Use Quarto's markdown syntax to add sections, images, and other elements.

### `add_page.qmd`

-   **Description**: An additional Quarto document that serves as a template for creating new pages on the project website.
-   **Usage**: Duplicate and edit this file to add more pages to the website. Customize the content as needed to fit the purpose of each additional page.

### `renv.lock`

-   **Description**: Lockfile used by `{renv}` to record the state of the project's R package environment, including exact package versions.
-   **Usage**: Share this file with collaborators to ensure that they can recreate the exact same R environment by using `renv::restore()`, providing consistent results across different systems.

## Getting Started {#getting-started}

1.  **Clone the Template**: Start by cloning this template repository to set up a new project.
2.  **Install Dependencies**: Use the `install_packages_and_load_libraries.R` script to install necessary R packages.
3.  **Customize**: Update the `.quarto.yml`, `index.qmd`, `add_page.qmd`, and other configuration files as needed for your specific project.

## Usage Guidelines {#usage-guidelines}

-   **Data Management**: Store raw data in `data/raw/` and processed data in `data/tidied/`. Use the `final_outputs/data/` folder for final datasets ready for publication.
-   **Assets**: Use the `assets/` folder for all images, logos, and styles to maintain a consistent look and feel across project outputs.
-   **Functions**: Use the `functions/` folder to keep reusable R scripts that automate tasks and manage dependencies.
-   **Documentation**: Maintain documentation in `README.md` files within each folder to describe the contents and usage guidelines.

## Previewing and Rendering Quarto Projects and Documents {#previewing-and-rendering-quarto-projects-and-documents}

This project template supports various types of Quarto outputs, including websites, reports, and presentations.
You can easily preview and render any document or the entire project using the commands below.

### How to Preview a Quarto Project or Document

1.  **Preview the Entire Project**:
    -   To preview the entire Quarto project (e.g., a website), you can run the following command from the terminal in your project directory:

        ``` bash
        quarto preview
        ```

    -   This command will start a local server and open your default web browser to show a live preview of the website.
        Any changes made to the Quarto files will automatically update in the preview.
2.  **Preview a Specific Document**:
    -   To preview a specific Quarto document (e.g., `index.qmd` or `add_page.qmd`), specify the file directly:

        ``` bash
        quarto preview index.qmd
        ```

    -   This command will render the specified document and open a preview in your default web browser.

### How to Render a Quarto Project or Document

1.  **Render the Entire Project**:
    -   To render the entire project (e.g., generate the complete website or report), use the following command:

        ``` bash
        quarto render
        ```

    -   This command will generate the output based on the settings in your `_quarto.yml` file, placing the results in the specified output directory (e.g., `docs/` for websites).
2.  **Render a Specific Document**:
    -   To render a specific Quarto document, specify the file directly:

        ``` bash
        quarto render index.qmd
        ```

    -   The rendered output will be generated according to the settings specified in the document and `_quarto.yml` file.

### Customizing Output Types

-   The project can be configured to output different types of documents such as HTML, PDF, or MS Word by modifying the `_quarto.yml` file and specifying the desired format.
    For example:

    ``` yaml
    project:
      type: website

    format:
      html: default
      pdf:
        documentclass: article
    ```

-   You can also specify output formats for individual documents by adding a format option in the YAML header of each `.qmd` file.
    For example:

    ``` yaml
    title: "My Report"
    format: pdf 
    ```

### Additional Tips

-   **Update and Install Packages**: Make sure to specify and install all required packages for a given project by using and customizing the provided `install_packages_and_load_libraries.R` script.
    Run this script before rendering documents to ensure all dependencies are satisfied.

-   **Sync with `renv`**: Use `renv::restore()` to sync your environment with the `renv.lock` file to match the project's package requirements.

-   **Live Preview**: Use `quarto preview` for a live updating preview.
    This is especially useful when making frequent changes to the content.

By following these instructions, you can easily preview and render your Quarto project or individual documents, enabling you to produce a wide range of outputs tailored to your research needs.
