# Assets Folder

This folder contains various assets used throughout the project, including images, logos, and style files.
These assets are essential for maintaining a consistent visual identity and styling across all project documents and presentations.

## Folder Structure

-   **images/**: Contains images used in reports, presentations, and other project documents. This can include charts, figures, and other visual elements that support the project's findings and communications.
-   **logos/**: Contains logo files for use in project documents and presentations, ensuring that branding is consistent and professional. This may include logos for the organization, project partners, or sponsors.
-   **styles.scss**: Contains styling definitions for the project, using SCSS (Sass) to manage styles in a structured way. This file helps maintain a consistent look and feel across all project documents and web pages.

## Guidelines

1.  **Organize by Type**: Store assets in the appropriate subfolder (`images/` for general images, `logos/` for logos). This keeps the assets well-organized and easy to find.
2.  **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive and consistent naming conventions for all assets to facilitate easy identification and usage. Use lowercase and snakecase for file names (e.g., `project_chart_2024.png`, `uhm_logo.png`).
3.  **Update and Maintain**: Regularly update the assets as needed, ensuring that any new images, logos, or styles are added to the appropriate subfolder and documented if necessary.
