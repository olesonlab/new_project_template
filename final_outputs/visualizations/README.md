# Visualizations Folder

This subfolder contains the final visualizations, including tables, graphs, and maps, that are used in reports, presentations, and publications.

## Guidelines

1.  **Store Only Final Visualizations**: Keep only final and approved visualizations in this subfolder. Drafts and intermediate versions should be stored in other appropriate folders.
2.  **Use Descriptive Naming Conventions**: Apply clear and descriptive file naming conventions to indicate the content and purpose of each visualization. Use the following format:
    -   Format: `[topic]_[type]_[date_range].filetype`
    -   Example: `temp_trends_linechart_2009_2023.png` for a line chart showing temperature trends from 2009 to 2023.
3.  **Document Visualizations**: Provide a brief description of each visualization in this `README.md` to explain its purpose and contents.
