# Final Outputs Folder Overview

This folder contains the final outputs of the analysis, including processed data and visualizations.

## Structure

-   **data/**: Contains final processed data files that are ready for reporting and publication. Use clear and consistent naming conventions to facilitate easy identification:
    -   **Format**: `finalized_[source_acronym]_[location]_[observation_description]_[date_range].csv`
    -   **Example**: `finalized_noaa_mhi_temp_summary_2009_2023.csv` for NOAA temperature data summary from the Main Hawaiian Islands covering 2009 to 2023.
-   **visualizations/**: Contains final visualizations such as tables, graphs, and maps used in reports and presentations. Follow a similar naming convention to clearly describe the visualization:
    -   **Format**: `[topic]_[type]_[date_range].filetype`
    -   **Example**: `temp_trends_linechart_2009_2023.png` for a line chart showing temperature trends from 2009 to 2023.

Each subfolder has its own `README.md` with specific guidelines and descriptions of the contents.
